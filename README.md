neural network to solve mazes and other pathing problems

The Basic organization of this project is a simple heirarchy of modules and packages. 
The naming convention for packages stem from the Greek Myth of the Labyrinth.
Seeing as this project is intended to solve mazes I thought the story was apt source
material. 

Daedalus -> package consiting of classes, utilities and scripts meant to model and display mazes of various kinds
Ariadne -> package consisting of classes, utilities and scripts mean to setup a neural network which will solve the mazes.
